On the right side of the application is your actions checklist. From here you can select one or more file operations you'd like to execute on your input file. On the right side of the application is the file management zone and start button. From here you will be able to input a file, select the ouput for your newly generated file(s), and name the output files.

## Steps:
1. Drop your node attributes excel sheet you got from Katapult into the file drag and drop area at the top of the right side.
2. Click the Select Output button to choose the output location for your new files.
3. Enter in an output file name if desired. This will default to the same filename as your inputted filename.
4. Select which operation(s) you would like to perform on the file.
5. Click Process File and wait for the progress bar to say complete.
6. Done! Check that your files were outputted properly.

### Note: Input file should be node attributes xlsx. Not with ID's or any other file format from katapult. This may cause data to be read improperly.
